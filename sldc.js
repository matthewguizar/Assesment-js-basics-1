// In this section you will answer some work through problems related to the Software Development Lifecycle

//////////////////PROBLEM 1////////////////////
/*
    Reorganize the following steps of the Software Development Lifecycle to be in their correct order.
*/

// Planning
// Analysis of Requirements
// Design
// implementation
// testing and integration
// Maintain

//////////////////PROBLEM 2////////////////////
/*
    Create a variable for each of the above steps of the Software Development Lifecycle and set the values of each variable to a definition of the step.
    The first one is done for you.

const planning = "This is the first step, in which the end goal of the software is determined and defined. Developers typically will see what systems are already in place, and determine what features will need to be added." 

const analysis =  `This is the second step, in which the requirements to reach end are determined. Understanding what is needed.`

const design = `This is the third step, where the team is now taking the first steps to creating their vision.`

const implementation = `code is written and features are built in`

const testing = `Initial tests after some design is done to find and fix bugs before further design/implementation deploy to users`

const maintain = `After finished product constant bug fixes and maintenance must be done to ensure everything continues to run smoothly`
